### Why have this?

Organizational memory is incredibly low in student-run organizations. Unless anything is done, close to 80% of the wisdom of members will leave Tech@NYU upon graduation. Documentation serves to retain as much of this 80% as possible. This memory also informs our culture and brand, Tech@NYU's most important asset.

The [branding toolkit](https://github.com/TechAtNYU/branding) defines the visual identity, however in communicating with the external world, we need a coherent voice.

### Externally

1. **In communicating to students, faculty, speakers, and community members, sound professional but colloquial.** Too formal, and you come off sounding like a robot that's trying too hard. Too informal, and you come across as sloppy and inconsiderate.

2. **Use your own voice.**

3. **Be humble.** Tech@NYU has a great brand. It's very easy to aggrandize the "awesomeness" of Tech@NYU, however it's probably bad taste to do so. *Show* everyone how awesome Tech@NYU is. Don't tell them. This takes more thought (nooooooo), but the returns have been self-evident in our rock solid brand.

4. **Know your audience.** If they're students, what are the demographics? If it's an investor, what's his or her portfolio and what's your relationship to them?

5. **Be concise and make their job easy.** This means:
	- If you want to meet, offer 2-3 possible times and locations to meet / talk
	- If you want an endorsement, write something and ask them to okay
	- If you need advice, have a specific question answerable with 1-2 sentences
	- If you want them to speak, provide all the details and offer to provide accommodations

6. **Get an introduction if possible.** This is advice for life. 99% of great things happen by way of introduction. Develop and nurture your relationships and ask for introductions.

7. **Follow up.** People are busy. They forget. Maybe your email was too long. Reach out again in a couple of days, respectfully.


### Internally

1. **We like GIFs a lotz.** Feel free to use them internally and in the digest. You'll have to find your own ;)

2. **Responsiveness is key.**
	- Allows us to move fast
	- Most importantly, fast responses build [trust](http://www.strategy-business.com/article/20964?pg=all).
	- If you're going to respond at a later time, let the person know
